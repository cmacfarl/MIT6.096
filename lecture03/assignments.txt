1. Up until now your executable programs have been named a.out.
   To name your program something else use the -o option to g++.

   For example to name hello_world 'hw' use

     g++ hello_world.cpp -o hw

   When you run your program instead of a.out, type hw at the command
   prompt.

2. Write a program that will output a right isosceles triangle of
   height and width N where N is a number entered by the user.

   For example:

	Enter number: 6
	*
	**
	***
	****
	*****
	******

3. Modify reverse.cpp so that it prints a word entered on the command
   line in reverse.

   For example:

   reverse foobar
   barfoo

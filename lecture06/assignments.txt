Bunnies Part One

	Create a class called Bunny.

	Each bunny has the following properties

	  Gender: Male, Female
	  Color: White, Brown, Black, Spotted
	  Age
	  Name: Randomly chosen at creation from an array of bunny names
	  Radioactive: True, False 

	The bunny class has the following member functions

	  gender_to_str() - converts the bunny's gender to a string
	  color_to_str() - converts the bunny's color to a string
	  print() - prints the bunny name and other properties
	  have_birthday() - increments the bunny's age
	  make_radioactive() - self explanatory
	  is_radioactive() - returns true if radioactive

	Instantiate five instances of a bunny and call the
	print member function for each.

	Use the provided rand class to generate random numbers.
    You may use two instances of rand to return numbers within 
	different ranges.  e.g.

		Rand color_rand(4);
		Rand gender_rand(2);

		color_rand returns a random number between 0 and 3.
		gender_rand returns a random number between 0 and 1

	Use these to index into an enumeration containing the values
	for a particular property.

Write a program that takes a filename as input and

  - counts the number of lines in a file
    where a line is terminated by a \n character
  - finds the longest line in the file.
  - outputs a . for each character and a newline
    at the end of each line.

For example, given a file named foo that contains the following

  My daddy said that I can
  get a puppy only
  if I get 1,000,000 likes!
  Please like

Would output

  cmacfarl@cmacfarl-VirtualBox:~/MIT6.096/lecture05$ a.out foo.txt
  .........................
  .................
  ..........................
  ............
  .
  foo.txt has 4 lines.
  The longest line is 26 characters

===========================================================================


For the next several problems, you should put your class 
definitions and function prototypes in a header file called 
geometry.h, and your function definitions in a file called
geometry.cpp. 

In this assignment you will implement a class representing a 
point, appropriately named Point.

 - Create the class with two private ints. Name them x and y.
 - Implement a single constructor that, if called with 0 arguments, 
   initializes a point to the origin – (0, 0) – but if called with 
   two arguments x and y, creates a point located at (x, y).
   Hint: You will need to use default arguments.
 - Support the following operations using the given function signatures:
    • Get the x coordinate
	 	int Point::getX() const
	• Get the y coordinate
		int Point::getY() const
	• Set the x coordinate
		void Point::setX(const int new x)
	• Set the y coordinate
		void Point::setY(const int new y)

There is no skeleton for this assignement.  Please refer to
the lecture notes for examples.
